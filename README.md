# KPI Collection Tool

CLI tool to automate KPI metrics collection from Prometheus/Thanos on
OpenShift clusters, with built-in storage and Grafana visualization.

## Motivation

Typically, developers and admins collect metrics from OpenShift clusters by running manual curl commands inside the Prometheus pod, crafting URL-encoded PromQL queries, and parsing the JSON output with `jq`:

```bash
PROM_API='http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query'
PROM_QUERY='query=rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{id="/system.slice/crio.service"}[5m])'

oc exec -n openshift-monitoring prometheus-k8s-0 -- \
  curl -ks $PROM_API --data-urlencode $PROM_QUERY \
  | jq '.data.result[] | .value[0] as $ts | .value[1] as $v | {ts: ($ts | todateiso8601), value: $v}'
```

The `jq` filters plus some bash magic can produce good enough output, but this approach doesn't scale — when you need to collect dozens of KPIs repeatedly, store results over time, or share them across a team, it quickly becomes error-prone and tedious.

kpi-collector replaces this manual workflow. You define your queries in a simple YAML file, point the tool at a cluster, and it takes care of retrieving the metrics, hiding the Prometheus query issuing, and handling the subsequent parsing, storage, and visualization.

## What it does

kpi-collector connects to an OpenShift cluster, queries Prometheus/Thanos for the metrics you define in a simple YAML file, and stores the results in a local SQLite database or a PostgreSQL server. You can then query the stored data from the command line or visualize it in a pre-configured Grafana dashboard.

The tool handles all the plumbing automatically: discovering the Thanos URL, creating a short-lived service account token, scheduling repeated queries at the frequency you choose, and managing the database lifecycle. You just provide a kubeconfig and a list of PromQL queries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The kubeconfig must belong to a user with admin privileges or sufficient permissions to create tokens for the `prometheus-k8s` service account in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace.

Three collection modes are supported: **periodic retrieval** (collect at a set frequency over a duration), **single-shot** (`--once` — collect every KPI once and exit), and **range queries** (fetch a window of historical data points in a single call).

## Who is this for

- **Telco partners** validating KPIs on RAN, Core, or Hub OpenShift clusters
- **SREs and platform engineers** who need to capture cluster health metrics
  over time for analysis or compliance
- **Anyone** running OpenShift who wants a simple way to collect and store
  Prometheus metrics without building a pipeline

## Architecture

![Architecture](docs/images/how-it-works.png)

## Key features

- **No cluster setup required** — works with any OpenShift cluster out of the box
- **Kubeconfig auto-discovery** — automatically finds Thanos and creates a service account token
- **Built-in KPI profiles** — generate ready-to-use KPI files for RAN, Core, or Hub clusters
- **Flexible storage** — SQLite (default, zero config) or PostgreSQL
- **Grafana dashboard** — one command to launch a pre-configured dashboard
- **Single binary** — no runtime dependencies, runs on Linux and macOS

## Example: collect and query

Create a `kpis.yaml` file with the queries you want to collect:

```yaml
kpis:
  - id: node-cpu-usage
    promquery: avg by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!="idle"}[5m]))

  - id: cluster-uptime
    promquery: sum(up)
```

Run the collector:

```bash
$ kpi-collector run \
    --cluster-name my-cluster --cluster-type ran \
    --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config --kpis-file kpis.yaml --once

KPI Collector starting...
Cluster name: my-cluster (type=ran)
Log file: kpi-collector-artifacts/kpi-2026-04-12-143000.log
Database: sqlite (kpi-collector-artifacts/kpi_metrics.db)
✓ Validated 2 KPI(s)

KPI Collection Stopped: Single run completed
All queries completed successfully!

```bash
$ kpi-collector db show kpis --name node-cpu-usage --limit 3
