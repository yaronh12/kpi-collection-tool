## KPI File Format

KPIs are defined in a JSON file passed to `--kpis-file`. Each entry describes a PromQL query to execute against Prometheus/Thanos.

Minimal example:

```json
{
    "kpis": [
        {
            "id": "node-cpu-usage",
            "promquery": "avg by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!=\"idle\"}[5m]))"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | - | Unique identifier used in the database and output |
| `promquery` | Yes | - | PromQL query to execute |
| `sample-frequency` | No | global `--frequency` | Per-query override (duration string like `"2m"` or seconds like `120`) |
| `run-once` | No | false | Collect this query only once, skip repeated sampling |
| `query-type` | No | `"instant"` | `"instant"` or `"range"` |
| `step` | No* | - | Resolution between points in a range query |
| `range` | No* | - | Lookback window for a range query |

\* Required when `query-type` is `"range"`

```json
{
    "kpis": [
        {
            "id": "node-cpu-usage",
            "promquery": "avg by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!=\"idle\"}[5m]))"
        },
        {
            "id": "node-memory-usage",
            "promquery": "node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes",
            "sample-frequency": "2m"
        },
        {
            "id": "cluster-uptime",
            "promquery": "max(time() - process_start_time_seconds{job=\"kubelet\"})",
            "run-once": true
        },
        {
            "id": "node-cpu-usage-range",
            "promquery": "avg by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!=\"idle\"}[5m]))",
            "query-type": "range",
            "step": "30s",
            "range": "1h"
        }
    ]
}
```

## KPI Profiles

The tool includes built-in KPI profiles for common cluster types. Use the `kpis generate` command to create a ready-to-use file:

```bash
# Generate all KPIs for a RAN cluster
kpi-collector kpis generate ran --all

# Interactively choose which categories to include
kpi-collector kpis generate core

# Custom output path
kpi-collector kpis generate hub --all -f /path/to/hub-kpis.json
```

Available profiles:

| Profile | Use Case | KPIs |
|---------|----------|------|
| `ran` | RAN DU single-node clusters (reserved/isolated CPUs, hugepages, PTP, OVN) | 31 |
| `core` | Core clusters (control plane, etcd, API server, ingress, storage) | 22 |
| `hub` | Hub/ACM clusters (managed clusters, policy compliance, GitOps, etcd) | 22 |

The generated file can be edited freely — add, remove, or tweak queries to match your needs.

## Frequency and Duration

The `--frequency` and `--duration` flags control how metrics are collected over time. The number of samples collected equals `duration / frequency`.

- `--frequency`: how often to collect metrics (default: `1m`)
- `--duration`: total collection time before stopping (default: `45m`)

| Frequency | Duration | Samples | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------|
| 60s | 45m | 45 | Default, balanced monitoring |
| 30s | 1h | 120 | Detailed analysis |
| 120s | 2h | 60 | Longer observation, less granularity |
| 10s | 5m | 30 | Quick troubleshooting |
| 300s (5m) | 24h | 288 | Long-term monitoring |


## Single Run Mode (`--once`)

Use `--once` to collect every KPI exactly once and exit. When set, `--frequency` and `--duration` are ignored.

Useful for:
- One-off snapshots of cluster metrics
- CI/CD pipelines that need a single data point
- Quick validation that queries and connectivity work
- Range queries that already aggregate over a time window

```bash
kpi-collector run \
  --cluster-name my-cluster \
  --cluster-type ran \
  --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config \
  --kpis-file kpis.json \
  --once
```

## Per-Query `run-once`

Individual queries can be marked with `"run-once": true` in the KPI file. These execute once at the start of collection and are excluded from the repeated sampling loop, even when running with `--frequency` and `--duration`.

Useful for:
- Range queries that aggregate over a window (e.g. `rate(...[30m])`)
- Static cluster information (uptime, version, node count)
- Baseline snapshots before continuous monitoring begins

```json
{
    "kpis": [
        {
            "id": "cluster-uptime",
            "promquery": "max(time() - process_start_time_seconds{job=\"kubelet\"})",
            "run-once": true
        },
        {
            "id": "node-cpu-usage",
            "promquery": "avg by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!=\"idle\"}[5m]))"
        }
    ]
}
```

In this example, `cluster-uptime` runs once immediately, while `node-cpu-usage` is sampled repeatedly at the configured frequency.

If all queries are marked `"run-once": true`, the collector executes them all once and exits without waiting for the duration timer.

## Range Queries

Set `"query-type": "range"` to execute a Prometheus range query instead of an instant query. Range queries return a series of data points over a time window.

```json
{
    "id": "node-cpu-range",
    "promquery": "avg by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!=\"idle\"}[5m]))",
    "query-type": "range",
    "step": "30s",
    "range": "1h"
}
```

How the time controls relate:

- `sample-frequency` — how often the collector executes this query
- `range` — how far back each execution looks
- `step` — spacing between data points in the returned range
- PromQL windows like `rate(...[5m])` control the per-point lookback, independent of the above

## Dynamic CPU IDs from PerformanceProfile CRs

Queries can use `{{RESERVED_CPUS}}` and `{{ISOLATED_CPUS}}` placeholders. These are replaced at startup with CPU IDs from PerformanceProfile CRs in the cluster. This feature requires `--kubeconfig` authentication.

```json
{
    "id": "cpu-reserved-set",
    "promquery": "rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{cpu=~\"{{RESERVED_CPUS}}\"}[30m])"
}
```
